            <p>The Resident Evil Timeline app aims to be an all-encompassing timeline tool that resolves the age old issues static documents have; because the franchise contains so much media, hyper detailed pieces contain way more data a single person would be meaning to look for and paradoxically, any restricted piece fails to cover all possible needs.</p>
            <p>This app is customizable and can satisfy whatever anyone is searching for. It has the functionality to;</p>
            <ul>
              <li>sort by release date or by in-universe date</li>
              <li>filter by the media type i.e. games, movies, both, everything etc.</li>
              <li>filter by canon status i.e. main canon, anderson, no-plot</li>
              <li>show entries like Resident Evil 2 as single or multiple entries to accurately represent the multiple instances it takes place in time</li>
              <li>toggle accessibility notes; for those wanting to know what's feasible for them to experience and access</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Create the exact timeline you've been looking for!</p>
